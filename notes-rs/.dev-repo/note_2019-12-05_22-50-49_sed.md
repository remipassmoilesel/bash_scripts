5.2.1. Printing lines containing a pattern

This is something you can do with grep, of course, but you can't do a "find and replace" using that command. This is just to get you started.

This is our example text file:


sandy ~> cat -n example
     1  This is the first line of an example text.
     2  It is a text with erors.
     3  Lots of erors.
     4  So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
     5  This is a line not containing any errors.
     6  This is the last line.

sandy ~>

We want sed to find all the lines containing our search pattern, in this case "erors". We use the p to obtain the result:


sandy ~> sed  '/erors/p' example
This is the first line of an example text.
It is a text with erors.
It is a text with erors.
Lots of erors.
Lots of erors.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

sandy ~>

As you notice, sed prints the entire file, but the lines containing the search string are printed twice. This is not what we want. In order to only print those lines matching our pattern, use the -n option:


sandy ~> sed -n '/erors/p' example
It is a text with erors.
Lots of erors.
So much erors, all these erors are making me sick.

sandy ~>

5.2.2. Deleting lines of input containing a pattern

We use the same example text file. Now we only want to see the lines not containing the search string:


sandy ~> sed '/erors/d' example
This is the first line of an example text.
This is a line not containing any errors.
This is the last line.

sandy ~>

The d command results in excluding lines from being displayed.

Matching lines starting with a given pattern and ending in a second pattern are showed like this:


sandy ~> sed -n '/^This.*errors.$/p' example
This is a line not containing any errors.

sandy ~>

Note that the last dot needs to be escaped in order to actually match. In our example the expression just matches any character, including the last dot.
